Run main.py

hearts --> click the cards to play them

Rules:
The player holding the 2 of clubs after the pass makes the opening lead. 

Each player must follow suit if possible. If a player is void of the suit led, a card of any other suit may be discarded. 

However, if a player has no clubs when the first trick is led, a heart (or the Queen of Spades) cannot be discarded. 

The highest card of the suit led wins a trick and the winner of that trick leads next. There is no trump suit.

The winner of the trick collects it. Hearts may not be led until a heart or the queen of spades has been discarded. 
The queen does not have to be discarded at the first opportunity.

Each heart - 1 point
The Q - 13 points

When anyone gets to 20 points (for this demo version), the game will end, and the player
with the lowest score will win (unless there's a tie, in which case play will continue)
